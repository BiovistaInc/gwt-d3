 * The result of the {@link Selection#data} methods. This represents the selected DOM elements that were successfully
 * bound to the specified data elements.
 * <p>
 * The update selection also contains a reference to the {@link #enter()} and {@link #exit()} selections, for adding and removing nodes in correspondence with data. For example, if
 * the default by-index key is used, and the existing selection contains fewer elements than the specified data, then the enter selection will contain placeholders for the new
 * data. On the other hand, if the existing contains more elements than the data, then the exit selection will contain the extra elements. And, if the existing selection exactly
 * matches the data, then both the enter and exit selections will be empty, with all nodes in the update selection.
 * <p>
 * For more details, see the short tutorial <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/">Thinking With Joins</a>.
 * <p>
 * If a key function is specified, the data operator also affects the index of nodes; this index is passed as the second argument i to any operator function values. However, note
 * that existing DOM elements are not automatically reordered; use {@link Selection#sort(java.util.Comparator)} or {@link Selection#order()} as needed.
