	 * Runs the tree layout, returning the array of nodes associated with the

	 * hierarchical layouts. These layouts follow the same basic structure: the
	 * input argument to layout is the root node of the hierarchy, and the
	 * output return value is an array representing the computed positions of
	 * all nodes. Several attributes are populated on each node:
	 * 
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>parent - the parent {@link Node}, or null for the root.
	 * <li>children - the array of child nodes, or null for leaf nodes.
	 * <li>depth - the depth of the node, starting at 0 for the root.
	 * <li>x - the computed x-coordinate of the node position.
	 * <li>y - the computed y-coordinate of the node position.
	 * </ul>
	 * 
	 * Although the layout has a size in x and y, this represents an arbitrary
	 * coordinate system; for example, you can treat x as a radius and y as an
	 * angle to produce a radial rather than Cartesian layout.
	 * 
	 * @param root of the the tree
	 * @return array of {@link Node} in the tree stemming from root

	 * 
	 * <ul>
