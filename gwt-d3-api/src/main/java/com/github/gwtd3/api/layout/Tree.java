 * Per the <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Tree-Layout">d3 API
 * reference</a>, the tree layout produces tidy node-link diagrams of trees
 * using the Reingold–Tilford “tidy” algorithm. Like most other layouts, the
 * object returned by d3.layout.tree is both an object and a function. That
 * is: you can call the layout like any other function, and the layout has
 * additional methods that change its behavior. Like other classes in D3,
 * layouts follow the method chaining pattern where setter methods return the
 * layout itself, allowing multiple setters to be invoked in a concise
 * statement.
